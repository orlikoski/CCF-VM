## Purpose
Skadi is a free, open source collection of tools that enables the collection, processing and advanced analysis of forensic artifacts and images. It scales to work effectively on laptops, desktops, servers, the cloud, and can be installed on top of hardened / gold disk images. 
  
## Skadi Wiki Page
The answers to common questions and information about how to get started with Skadi is stored in the [Skadi Wiki Pages](https://github.com/orlikoski/skadi/wiki).
  
## Skadi Community
There is a Slack community setup for developers and users of the Skadi ecosystem. It is a safe place to ask questions and share information.
