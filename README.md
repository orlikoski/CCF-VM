## What's New
*  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Support!!!!
*  CyLR 1.4.0
*  CDQR 4.1.1
*  Plaso 20171231
*  OS Updates

## Purpose
The CCF-VM was designed to provide an all-in-one solution to parsing collected data, making it easily searchable with built-in common searches, enable searching of single and multiple hosts simultaneously (stacking).  It was very important that this was done with open source solutions.

## Curl-to-Bash Installation
This type of installation is for users with some experience with linux administration. It is ideal for those that are required to build upon a baseline (gold disk) image. It also works very well for cloud based instances as a build script. It ensures that the most recent versions of the software are used and that it is configured the same way every time.  Also note that all ciphers and keys are generated at run time and therefore are as unique as any script can make them.

This is a script that installs and configures, including the creation of systemd services if not included otherwise, the following items onto a base image of Ubuntu/Debian (need apt to work).
    *  CDQR 4.1.3 (pulls most recent from Git repo)
    #  CyLR 1.4.0 (pulls most recent from Git repo)
    *  ElasticSearch 6.x
    *  Logstash 6.x
    *  Kibana 6.x
    *  TimeSketch 20170721
    *  Neo4j 3.3.3
    *  Celery 4.1.0
    *  Redis 4.0.8
    *  PostgreSQL 9.5.11

Installation instructions
*  Start with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or equivalent Debian base installation
*  Login to system with an account that has sudo privledges (The name doesn't have be `cdqr` but it is nostalgic)
*  Start the script with either of these two options (No-Proxy or Behind a Proxy)

No-proxy
```
sudo apt install curl -y # Ensure curl is installed
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rough007/CCF-VM/master/scripts/buildccf.sh |bash # 
```

Behind a Proxy
```
sudo apt install curl -y # Ensure curl is installed
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rough007/CCF-VM/master/scripts/buildccf_behind_proxy.sh |bash # 
```

*  Now wait, this could take anywhere from 5 - 60+ minutes depending on the speed of the internet connection

The final completion will look something like this (version numbers may change over time):
```
System Health Checks

  Bringing up postgresql

Verifying versions of Plaso and CDQR
plaso - log2timeline version 20180127
CDQR Version: 4.1.3

```

Not 100% complete, but very close. The reason this is for advanced users is that the remaining items require loading sample data into the ElasticSearch in order to create the default index in Kibana as well as load the pre-made Dashboards, Visualizations, and Searches into Kibana (requires the correct indexes to work).

Simple steps to complete the remaining steps:
*  Run sample data through CDQR into the ElasticSearch database (sample Virtual Machines can be found at the [DFIR Training](https://www.dfir.training/tools/virtualization-and-forensics/virtual-machines-downloads) site or by using CyLR to collect from a sample host (much faster).
  *  Sample Command: `~/cdqr.py -p win <disk image or CyLR resulting .zip file> --es_kb testing`  
*  The first time logged into Kibana it asks to create a default index.  Use `case_cdqr-*` for the index and ensure that the data is fully loaded from previous step
*  In Kibana click Management -> Saved Objects -> Import and use the file that has all of the CCF-VM specific Dashboards/Visualizations/Searches [kibana_6.x.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rough007/CCF-VM/master/objects/kibana_6.x.json)

That's it. The setup is complete.

## Analyzing Data in Three Easy Steps
1.	Collect information from host
2.	Process / parse collected data
3.	Start reviewing data

## Collect information from host
The CyLR tool can assist with collecting data from Windows hosts but any tool can be used to collect the forensic image or collect the artifacts.  SFTP can be used to transfer the files securely to the CCF-VM.


## CyLR Collection Example
To execute CyLR on the host to SFTP the data directly to the CCF-VM use the following command:  
```
CyLR.exe -u cdqr -p Changemen0w! -s <CCF-VM IP address> -m
```

NOTE:
*  File is uploaded to the user, “cdqr”, home directory of the CCF-VM (/home/cdqr) 
 

## Process / parse collected data
The CCF-FM has a customized version of CDQR (Linux 2.02 with Elasticsearch).  This write up makes the assumption that the source is either a .zip file with artifacts, a directory with artifacts in it, or a directory with forensic system image files in it (example collect.E01).   The CCF-VM uses the Cold Disk Quick Response (CDQR) tool to process individual artifacts or entire system images.

The best practice is to put all of the artifacts into one folder (or zip file).
 

## Examples of using CDQR to process the data and output to into Elasticsearch
If the data is from a windows host, in a .zip file, “example_hostname.zip”, then use the following command
```
cdqr.py example_hostname.zip -p win --max_cpu -z --es example_index
```
If the data is from a windows host, in a directory, “example_dirname”, then use the following command
```
cdqr.py example_dirname -p win --max_cpu --es example_index
```
If the data is from a mac host, is a forensic image file(s) then use the following command
```
cdqr.py example_dirname/example_hostname.E01 -p mac --max_cpu --es example_index
```

## Kibana Interface

## Using Kibana Pre-built Items
There are multiple ways to interface with the data and this document will show the following pre-built items included: Searches, Visualizations and Dashboards.  These were made to provide a way to easily start looking at data and maximize the data provided by CDQR and Plaso.  

They were made to be hierarchical so that Searches are used to make Visualizations which are then used to make Dashboards.  This means that changes to the saved searches will be automatically updated in the Visualizations and Dashboards that use them.

## Searches
16 pre-built searches in the CCF-VM.  Table below contains the list of the built in Kibana Searches in CCF-VM.

| Name               | Search String                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Using Indices Intelligently
By default, CCF-VM has an index of “case_cdqr-*” and this allows for searching all data uploaded by CDQR.
 
##  Search just one host or collection of artifacts
To view data from just one host/collection of artifacts a new index is required.  To create a new index replace the “logstash-\*” in the upper white box with “case_cdqr-\<index_name\>\*”.  This must match what was used in the CDQR command line.   In this example, “case_cdqr-test*” is used.

Next, the white box under the “Time-field name” entry must have “datetime” populated in it and the “Create” button turned green.  If that does not happen then check the index name to ensure it is accurate.

## Data Cleanup
To remove the index go to the Elasticsearch-KOPF cluster management interface: http://<CCF-VM IP address or localhost>:9200/_plugin/kopf/#!/cluster

## VirtualBox Notes
To enable Bridged Networking use the following:
*  "ifconfig -a" to get interface name
*  "sudo ifconfig \<interface name\> up" to bring up the interface
*  "sudo dhclient" to get an IP address
